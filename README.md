Every year my local garbage collection company publishes the dates for collection of separate garbage types as a printed
(or digital pdfx) calendar. They also offer an app that somehow is supposed to remind you of the dates, but who wants
an extra app for that when there's already calendars you could subscribe to?

I just want the dates in my Nextcloud calendar instead of their stupid app, but I don't want to enter them via the GUI
one by one, because I can type way faster than I can click.

So... I created this little script where I can enter the dates quickly in a convenient format and generate an ICS file
that I then can import into a calendar in Nextcloud.

## Caveats / Issues

This is super basic. The original calendar actually contains more event series than interest me and it might make more
sense to have a separate calendar for each series if you are more serious about sharing the results with anyone.
