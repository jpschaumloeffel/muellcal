# muellcal

Every year my local garbage collection company publishes the dates for collection of separate garbage types as a printed calendar.
I want the dates in my Nextcloud calendar instead, but I don't want to enter them via the GUI one by one.
So I created this little script where I can enter the dates quickly in a convenient format and generate an ICS file that I can import into a calendar in Nextcloud.
